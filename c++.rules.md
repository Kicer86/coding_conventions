### Formatting

* No tabs, 4 spaces indention
* Spaces around arithmetic operators. Example: int a __=__ 1 __+__ 2;
 
### Naming
* Type name should start with capital letter and have a capital letter for each new word. 

  Example: Class, ClassName, MyTypeDef
  
  This rule applies to classes, structs, typedefs, enums etc.
  
* Functions and methods should start with lowercase and have capital letter for each new word.

  Example: myGlobalFunction, Class::someMethod
